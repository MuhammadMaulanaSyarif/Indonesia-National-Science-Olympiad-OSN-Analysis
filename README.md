The Indonesia National Science Olympiad (OSN) is the largest student olympiad in Indonesia as an event to compete in various fields between provinces at the high school level

The analysis I use is to find out the number of provinces that participated and won medals at The Indonesia National Science Olympiad (OSN) at the junior high school and high school levels 

**GOAL**
1. Participation at the high school and junior high school levels in each province
2. Medalist at the high school and junior high school levels in each province
3. Acquisition of medal and non-medal participants at the high school level
4. Acquisition of medal and non-medal participants at the junior high school level
5. Percentages based on gender in participants and medalists at the high school and junior high school levels

**Insights**
1. From participant: Central Java excels in numbers at the high school level and East Java at the junior high school level
2. From Medalist: DKI Jakarta excels in high school and Central Java at the junior high school level
3. Ratio of medalists and non-medalists: DKI excels at the high school and junior high school levels
4. Gender participant: males are superior in the number of females at the high school and junior high school levels
5. Gender Medalist: Male is superior in number to female at the high school and junior high school levels

1. Increase participation from underrepresented provinces by providing training and logistical support.
2. Expand access to training and resources in non-flagship provinces to increase medal opportunities.
3. Encourage women's participation through mentorship programs, scholarships, and inspirational campaigns.
4. Provide feedback and follow-up training for non-medalist participants to improve their competencies.
